                <p>So, that new bird I keep talking about?</p><p>I've NEVER seen them in class! Not once!</p><p>I asked Berdly about it once (I was desperate okay X) ) and he didn't have a clue either! I thought, you know... they're both birds, right? Too insensitive X) Alphys didn't know either... thought I don't think shes allowed to tell that information anyways.</p><p>So, one day as Crush and I were walking out of class together, I brought it up. I mean they were meant to sit behind Crush... he could have like... blackmailed them out of our class X) surely Crush isn't THAT evil. lol</p><p>I said bye to him as we reached the exit of the building (Crush was rather slow that day!), but he stayed behind. So I... well, I'm not a weirdo or anything, but I was just too curious X) especially after having mentioned... Fera, was their name? I'm usually good at these, help me out here!</p><p>He had stayed by the school fence, right up against the apartment buildings (waiting for Ms. Dreemurr, maybe). Fera was standing right against the alley on the other end, smoking (as I feared from the smell X( ). </p><p>"...hey."</p><p>Crush hadn't looked up, or ushered a word.</p><p>"...yer human, aren't ya?" (They spoke in a weird western-ish accent?)</p><p>Crush raised his head, but his glasses were so misty I couldn't even tell if he was listening!</p><p>"Are y'even listenin'? ...Crush, ain't ya?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>"Crush. Hehe... I heard 'bout you."</p><p>They leaned in, sticking their beak through a large unpatched area of fence. It looked almost cartoonish X) From there, they began to pry the boards down, chipping away at the wood using their beak. After a long silence, they had gotten a board down (no IDEA how they got it back up!)</p><p>It was then I thought back and remembered that nothing would come of this and I didn't want to be involved in this... crime, I guess X) But... I was a bit worried about Crush, after all. He hadn't even tried to defend himself! Raise your head from the books from time to time Crush!!! X)</p><p>Fera began to speak again as they pushed a board aside.</p><p>"I ain't never seen a real human..."</p><p>They began to get REAL close to Crush... sniffling him down, their beak twitching and taking in the scent... the whole thing X) Poor Crush had to stand there and take it</p><p>"...Humans talk, right? Go on, say somethin'." (as if THEY weren't the parrot X) )</p><p>"..."</p><p>Again, Crush was silent! I almost had to force myself not to step in, if it weren't for the broken property X)</p><p>"...well, real shame if YOU don't. Yer nuthin' like them humans in cartoons."</p><p>They paused to take a big, long drag from their lit cigarette X( I had to force myself to look away briefly, until...</p><p>I heard a snicker. </p><p>But it wasn't Fera's deep, western-ish one.</p><p>But, no, it was Crush's.</p><p>Maybe it was the way Fera was talking... I mean, talk about 'cartoons' for a moment while almost being a high schooler X)</p><p>WHATEVER it was making Crush laugh, Fera seemed to take it as being made fun of, and they almost immediately jolted up. I could see their little talons twitch as did their beak, but nothing was around to throw, so...</p><p>they grabbed Crush by the collar and held him up, their LIT cigarette falling to the LEAF ridden ground!</p><p>"Yer' even FUNNIER lookin' from up close! Did I say sumthin' wrong! Oh, boo-hoo! I'll conform like the rest of y... y'plebians, if it'll make y'feel better! So what if I 'appen to br a ruffian, eh? Look me in the eyes for a moment--I need a better look!"</p><p>Crush still didn't have a word to say, or maybe he just couldn't find the right ones. Fera seemed to take note of this and only brought Crush closer.</p><p>"Yer just like me, Crush. You exist in a world that would hardly be different with or without y'in it. So, better of not tryin'. The more y'continue, the more people'll get suck of you, and as soon as that 'appens..."</p><p>I could almost feel myself throwing up. They continued to hold the STILL silent Crush... </p><p>until I saw his mouth, only partially vibrate... </p><p>To be frank, I'm not sure he even said anything. It was only so little, especially in a large part of Hometown, who knows!</p><p>But, whatever it was, Fera's eyes didn't soften, but they were broken from their trance, and they dropped Crush, hardly, almost in an unthinking manner.</p><p>They took a few steps back into the alleyway, taking the few boards that they broke down and awkwardly plopping yhem back up... before going out of sight. They left their cigarette there X(</p><p>In the end I could still see their little ruffles of feathers poking out through the chipped off fence, and then from farther away, I heard the closing of a door, sounding like an apartment one. </p><p>I decided at last that I probably shouldn't have been there, so I turned around, but...</p><p>Crush was right there, staring at me (guess I was too focused on the cigarette and the fence to notice him standing up X) )</p><p>He adjusted his glasses and, without a word... we walked home that day.</p><p>WELL...</p><p>THAT JUST HAPPENED. LOL X)</p><p>I took a look through the library for books on humans, maybe if they come to class one day I can teach them and they won't pick on Crush so much X))))))))))))</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
